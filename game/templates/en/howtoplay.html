	<h1>How to play</h1>
	<p>Hello miner! I suppose you ought to be the latest Burma autarch. So pick up your shovel
	and pickaxe and get to work! Shown below is the mine, your goal is to dig it and find
	as much gems as you can before you adversary does, after all, you don't want to be
	enslaved by it, right!? Gems are rare, they say there are only 51 of them burried in the
	mine, so stop wasting time get right now to digging!</p>

	<br><br><br>

	<p>To open up your mine, you just need to send the link found right bellow the mine
	to your adversary. As soon as it connects, the run for the gems starts. But wait!!!
	You don't have a shovel! We can lend you one, but take great care of it, ok? It is
	the only one we have, and other miners borrows it, too, that is why all the action
	takes place in turns. So, wait for your shovel or pickaxe to show up, allowing you
	to cast your move.</p>

	<p>You have tools to help you in your quest. Besides your brain and your shovel,
	you have a gem proximity detector. When you dig, a number is shown. It means exactly
	how many gems are in immediate proximity of the dug tile. To be more precise, in the
	8 positions around the central one.</p>

	<p>For instance, in the rightmost picture, the number 1 highligted says there are
	precisely one gem hidden around that position. Since 7 of those positions are already
	dug and revealed, there is solely one place where the gem could be. You would just need
	to click (dig) that tile to find-it.</p>

	<p>This way, the numbers shown as the mine is dug are the clues telling the number of
	gems in the vicinity. When there are no gems about, you can dig like crazy mole until
	the numbers are found, revealing all the empty space around.</p>

	<br><br><br>

	<p> Caso você esteja perdendo o jogo, ou seja, a quando a quantidade de pedras preciosas
	que você encontrou ― mostrada no topo da mina ― é inferior a do seu oponente, você pode
	usar uma única carga de dinamite para explodir parte da mina. A potente dinamite abre um
	vão de 5 por 5 posições! As figuras abaixo mostram a dinamite sendo utilizada pelo
	minerador vermelho.</p>

	<br><br><br>

	<p>A escavação se encerra quando um dos mineradores encontra mais da metade das pedras
	preciosas. Ao final, é relevada a posição de todas as pedras preciosas que não foram
	encontradas ― contabilizadas ao vencedor!</p>
